# Nutrion-Tracker
Nutrition-Tracking software that provides specific food recommendations for people diets with AI agents 

Goal: Build an app/website capable of counting the caloric, macro and micro-nutrient intake of an individual. 

AT ALL STAGES: Consider UI-UX design to improve user retition

First stage: Minimal Viable Product (MVP) - Nutrition Tracker
Langauges: C++, Python, (My)SQL

    Step 1:
    Create a personal Database that organizes the relevant data found in the FoodData Central database into Schema's to be used

    Step 2:
    Create C++ backend that's able to compute the amount of calories, macro, and micro nutrients
    someone inputs within the system

    Step 3: Create a time-series database capable of storing each user's nutrional intake  information
    

    Step 4:  Create a database to store user data
    (Does Not Need to be in C++ or SQL, this most likely needs Cloud services to conenct google accounts)
    - Usernames/emails
    - Passwords
    - Nutrution information

    This software package/Github repo will serve as our MVP, launch of the product will begin after Stage 1 is complete.


Second Stage: Recipe Creation Feature
Third Stage: Recommendation System for Precision Nutrition with Cultural/dietary Consideration
Fourth Stage: AI-Pipeline for Nutrition app's Marketing Campaign
